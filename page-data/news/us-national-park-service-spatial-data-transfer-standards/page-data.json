The standards also help integrate the numerous cultural resource databases maintained by the NPS\nfor cultural resource management. In 2014 the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/crgis/index.htm\" title=\"NPS CRGIS\">Cultural Resource GIS Facility (CRGIS)</a> implemented these\nstandards with the Cultural Landscapes Inventory and List of Classified Structures databases.</p>\n<p>Working with NPS regional GIS coordinators as well as regional cultural resource managers, the project automates\nlegacy data contained within these databases, creating enhanced GIS data and forming a base for an authoritative NPS-wide\ncultural resource data set. The purpose of these spatial data transfer standards is to facilitate updating, transforming\nand integrating digital experiences within the US National Park Service to enhance public understanding as well as\ninternal NPS resource management.</p>","id":"08fad5da-51b6-5ab5-ac10-2fec4e3b8617","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":152},"excerpt":"In 2010 the US National Parkâ€¦","frontmatter":{"permalink":"/news/us-national-park-service-spatial-data-transfer-standards/","date":"February 14, 2017","last_modified_at":"October 20, 2023","title":"The US National Park Service and spatial data transfer standards","author":["Digital Standards Unit"],"tag":null}}},"pageContext":{"permalink":"/news/us-national-park-service-spatial-data-transfer-standards/","id":"08fad5da-51b6-5ab5-ac10-2fec4e3b8617"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2494122958","2643541817","4037206124"],"slicesMap":{}}
