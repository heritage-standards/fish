KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems and geographic information systems.</p>\n<p>Ontology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures representing the entities within a domain and the relationships between those entities. Ontologies, have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences: formal ontologies are a form of software, thus software development methodologies can be adapted to serve ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, especially given the current web emphasis, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce and business process design.</p>","id":"b2fb2327-1ab2-5cd4-be52-3f67216d8d90","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":293},"excerpt":"The 9th International Joint…","frontmatter":{"permalink":"/news/ic3k-2017-funchal-madeira-1-3-nov-2017/","date":"August 29, 2017","last_modified_at":"October 20, 2023","title":"IC3K 2017 (Madeira, 1-3 Nov 2017)","author":["Digital Standards Unit"],"tag":null}}},"pageContext":{"permalink":"/news/ic3k-2017-funchal-madeira-1-3-nov-2017/","id":"b2fb2327-1ab2-5cd4-be52-3f67216d8d90"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2494122958","3133867949","4037206124"],"slicesMap":{}}
