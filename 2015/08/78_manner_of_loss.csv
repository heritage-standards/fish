569,RAMMING,78,P,Deliberate collision with another vessel in order to inflict damage.

1422,DITCHED,78,P,An aircraft which has been forced to land on the sea in an emergency.
1423,CRASHED,78,P,An aircraft which has been damaged beyond repair due to a collision with the ground or sea.

5196,SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION,78,P,"Ignition from within rather than through external forces; frequently associated with cargoes of organic material such as manure, owing to an internal rise in temperature of the cargo itself."
5195,INSTRUMENT FAILURE,78,P,"Loss of a craft, especially aircraft, resulting from the malfunction of registering or measuring apparatus vital to its navigation or operation. In the case of structural or engine failure use MECHANICAL FAILURE."
5197,ENEMY ACTION,78,P,"Loss due to cumulative damage sustained during acts of warfare, capture, piracy, privateering etc. Use in instances where a more specific manner of loss (e.g. SCUTTLED, GUN ACTION) cannot be assigned."
5198,CONDEMNED,78,P,Judged as irreparable or no longer seaworthy following a wrecking incident (from which the vessel may have been recovered) or a difficult voyage: a term with legal force indicating that the vessel is unfit for service.
