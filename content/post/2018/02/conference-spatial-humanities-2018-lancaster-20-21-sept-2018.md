[Lancaster’s Digital Humanities Hub](http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/dighum/) is hosting a **Spatial Humanities 2018** conference in 
September 2018. The conference will explore what geospatial technologies such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) 
have to contribute to humanities research. The main aim is to explore and demonstrate the contributions to knowledge enabled 
by these technologies, approaches and methods within and beyond the digital humanities.  

Submissions on all aspects of using geospatial technologies in humanities research, including database development, 
methodological innovation and applied research that develops our understanding of the geographies of the past, is welcomed. 

Contributions are invited from all humanities disciplines, including (but not limited to) history (including fields from 
social science history such as historical demography and environmental history), archaeology, literary studies, classics, 
linguistics and religious studies, as well as from technical fields including GISc, digital humanities, computational 
linguistics and computer science.
