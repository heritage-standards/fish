At last year’s Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology UK (CAAUK) conference held in Edinburgh we 
held a special FISH session highlighting some of the recent applied work based on or associated with information standards. 

The session outline is below and the videos are available online (along with a number of other excellent presentations 
covering a whole range of topics)

## FISH session - Making the Links: Practical Applications of Data Standards 

The outcomes of data standards work provide the basis for a variety of applications used by archaeologists and information 
managers grappling with complex data sets. They allow information to be shared and accessed in increasingly innovative 
and flexible ways, by professional and public users alike, and the aim of this session is to look at current initiatives 
that demonstrate the way standards are being developed and used to share, link, and engage users.
