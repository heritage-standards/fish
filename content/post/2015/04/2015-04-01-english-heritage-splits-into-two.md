English Heritage has been a long-standing member of FISH.

From _1 April 2015_ English Heritage will separate into two organisations.

[English Heritage](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/) will become a charity and
continue to cater for the national Heritage Collection of over 400 historic places
and collections.

[Historic England](https://www.historicengland.org.uk/) will remain a Government
service offering expert advice on heritage and carry on working with FISH on standards
and terminology developments.
