The 9th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management

Funchal, Madeira – Portugal (1-3 November, 2017)

The conference hosts three separate mini-conferences. The purpose of the IC3K is to bring together researchers,
engineers and practitioners on the areas of Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and
Knowledge Management.

IC3K is composed of three co-located conferences, each specialized in at least one of the aforementioned main knowledge areas.

### [What is KEOD?](http://www.keod.ic3k.org/)

Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems and geographic information systems.

Ontology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures representing the entities within a domain and the relationships between those entities. Ontologies, have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences: formal ontologies are a form of software, thus software development methodologies can be adapted to serve ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, especially given the current web emphasis, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce and business process design.
