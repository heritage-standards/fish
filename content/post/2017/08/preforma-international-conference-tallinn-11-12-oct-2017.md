Hosted by the _National Library of Estonia_, the conference will include: keynote speeches by international experts in 
digital preservation; live demonstrations of the software; examples and good practices of memory institutions that are 
integrating the PREFORMA tools in their environments; and panel discussions to reflect on how to sustain and further 
develop the results of the project. The event is intended for anyone dealing with digital preservation of images,
