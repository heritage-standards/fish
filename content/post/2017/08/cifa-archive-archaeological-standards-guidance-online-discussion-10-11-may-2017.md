## Archaeological Standards and Guidance - What are they for and who sets them?

The Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA) held an online discussion on this topic on 10-11 May 2017. Key questions covered:

1.  A new vision for 2017 and beyond? Is the Southport vision is still relevant? Can we construct a new vision for 2017 and beyond? What outcomes do we want to achieve and what should standards therefore contain?
2.  Roles and responsibilities – who sets standards?Many organisations are involved in producing standards and guidance; do we yet have a common understanding about roles and responsibilities or are we all competing with each other? Who should lead on what?
3.  New thinking on methodology and standards - how do we capitalise on the lessons of synthesis projects, and translate them into professional practice?
4.  How much should we be prescribing methods as opposed to seeking outcomes?
5.  Should improving standards make our work more cost-effective or will they add cost?
