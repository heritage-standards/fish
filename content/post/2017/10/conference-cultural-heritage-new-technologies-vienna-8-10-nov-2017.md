## Combining Archaeology, History, and New Technologies

The conference aims to enhance the collaboration between historians and archaeologists
and related disciplines using new technologies and to showcase best practice applications
in multidisciplinary research.

When: **8-10 November 2017**

Where: the **[Museen der Stadt Wien – Stadtarchäologie](http://www.wien.gv.at/archaeologie/)**, in Vienna, Austria.

### Topics cover

*   Application of effective **3D-methods** for the reconstruction of buildings, integrating archaeological excavation data with historical sources including images, thus increasing our understanding of the past
*   Additional digital methods for the combined **visualisation** of archaeological and historical data (e.g. monitoring changes and preservation of archaeological monuments based on historical images).
*   Application of **new technologies** to assess the archaeological record based on historical data (maps, tax returns, inventories, ship wreck lists, etc.) and/or combining historical sources and archaeological data in a geographical information system for recording the history of urban or rural landscapes.
*   **Games, apps, and teaching software** integrating archaeological and historical knowledge
*   Historical data as a basis for checking or validating **digital tools** applied in archaeology and vice versa.
*   Dealing with **inscriptions** (including cuneiform, hieroglyphs and symbols): digital methods for enhancing readability (e.g. Reflectance Transformation Imaging), pattern recognition of letters or pictograms, comparison of hand writing (same author?).
*   **Statistical analysis** investigating the correlation between historical place names and archaeological evidence.
