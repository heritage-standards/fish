We have now updated the FISH Thesauri (version 20).  

Click [here](/fish-vocabularies/) to view the latest versions. Candidate terms (terminology suggestions) are submitted to FISH all year 
round. Terms are processed and usually added to the FISH thesauri and authority files as and when they come in. 

Once a year the main thesauri are updated and uploaded to this website, where you can browse for a specific term, 
and [Heritage Data](http://www.heritagedata.org/blog/vocabularies-provided/), a related website, where you can download key thesauri as [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) and [LOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) 
formats. Please get in touch if you have any questions regarding the FISH thesauri or candidate terms.
