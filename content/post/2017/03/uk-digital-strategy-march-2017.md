The Secretary of State for Culture Media & Sport has launched the Government’s UK Digital Strategy. The Strategy commits to ‘undertake a major enhancement and rationalisation of heritage records nationally and locally’ as well as considering how the planning system can be made both more efficient and give the public greater involvement through better use of data and digital tools.
