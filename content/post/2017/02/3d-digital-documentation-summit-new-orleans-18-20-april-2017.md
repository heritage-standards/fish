The purpose of this summit is to advance the use and understanding of the various methods of 3D digital documentation and
capture of cultural heritage. In addition, the summit aims to address issues with the long-term storage and management of
the data generated by 3D digital documentation. Also, the NPS hopes to start discussions on and establish goals for their
use of 3D digital documentation for architectural heritage. The Summit will include two days of lectures organized into
themed sessions. Presenters will be allotted 25 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions.

Also, during the first two days, a poster session will be held to highlight new, upcoming, and student research in 3D
