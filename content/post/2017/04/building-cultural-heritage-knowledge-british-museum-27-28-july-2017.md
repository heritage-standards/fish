A symposium on **Building Cultural Heritage Knowledge** will take place at the _British Museum_ on 27-28th July 2017. 

A workshop on building semantic databases will also be held on the 29th (tba). 

**Location:** British Museum, BP Lecture Theatre, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3DG

The conference seeks to highlight the challenges for sustainable knowledge building between cultural heritage institutions, 
universities and the other interested audiences.

> 'How do we combine knowledge, skills and experience to create digital resources that have high research value, 
> meaningful content, and are interesting to a wide range of people and groups? How can interdisciplinary work be 
> practically supported and maintained? How can the outputs of digital research be academically robust and accessible 
> for reuse in other projects? How can we avoid digital disruption and fragmentation? Finally, what role should cultural
> heritage institutions and organisations play in preserving and disseminating knowledge?'

A number of bursaries are available. The event is advertised with details on EventBrite
