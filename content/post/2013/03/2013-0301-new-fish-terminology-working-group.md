The former _Archaeology Terminology Working Group_ (ATWG) is expanding its remit to include all terminologies covered by 
MIDAS Heritage. The group is therefore changing its name to the [FISH Terminology Working Group](/working-groups/)
and will be run under the auspices of FISH. We are looking to expand membership and would welcome FISH members to express 
their interest in joining. The focus of the group is on the development of standards, and controlled vocabularies in 
particular, and as such experience or expertise in this area would be beneficial. 

Please [contact us](mailto:rdsuinfo@HistoricEngland.org.uk) if you are interested in joining the group.
