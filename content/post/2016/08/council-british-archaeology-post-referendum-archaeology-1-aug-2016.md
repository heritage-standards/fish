The Council for British Archaeology explores the long term impact of Brexit on British archaeology.  The article discusses:

*   Higher Education sector research networks and funding (UK's higher education institutions reliance on EU funding);
*   possible impact on the private sector (too soon to judge if this will be a long term negative trend);
*   and the opportunity for UK's government to revisit the decision to impose a 20% rate of VAT on the repair and conservation of historic buildings.
