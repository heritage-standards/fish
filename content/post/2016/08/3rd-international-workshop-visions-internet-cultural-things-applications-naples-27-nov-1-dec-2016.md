Naples (Italy), 27 November - 1 December 2016

'The combination of the Internet and emerging technologies such as [near-field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) and [BLE communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy), real-time localization, and embedded sensors lets us transform everyday objects into smart objects that can understand and react to their environment. In the last years, Cultural Heritage has turned out to be one of the most suitable domains in which such achievements can be profitably exploited, since it characterizes a domain where several aspects have to be considered at the same time. In line with [SITIS](http://www.sitis-conf.org/) tradition of promoting interdisciplinary research, the international workshop on _Visions on Internet of Cultural Things and Applications_, **VICTA â€™16**, aims to be a profitable informal working day to discuss together hot topics about [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) and its applications within the [Smart City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city) and the Cultural Heritage domain.'
