Welcome to our new website!

FISH changed its website on the 1st of July 2016.

Content is largely the same but we have added a few new sections, such as pointers to other terminology and heritage information resources.

We have changed the URL so please update your bookmark!

Please share and contribute content. Help us improve the website by keeping it relevant and current. Let us know of any developments within heritage data standards and terminology management that you or your organization is working on.

We look forward to hearing from you.

FISH
