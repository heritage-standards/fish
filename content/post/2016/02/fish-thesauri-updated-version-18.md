Candidate terms (terminology suggestions) are submitted to FISH all year round.
Terms are processed and usually added to the FISH thesauri and authority files as
and when they come in.

Every six months or so the main thesauri are updated and uploaded to this website,
where you can browse for a specific term, and [Heritage Data](http://www.heritagedata.org/blog/vocabularies-provided/),
a related website, where you can download key thesauri as [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values),
[PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) and [LOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) formats.
