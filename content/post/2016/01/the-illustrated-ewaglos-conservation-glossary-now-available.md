> 'EwaGlos, which has been developed in eleven languages, highlights the crucial role that professionally developed 
> multilingual vocabularies play in international preservation campaigns. The illustrated glossary stresses the importance 
> of a common language in the conservation field, and the role that international cooperation plays in creating this common 
> terminology. The core of the glossary comprises approximately 200 definitions of terms frequently used in specifications 
> in the field of conservation-restoration of wall paintings and architectural surfaces.'
