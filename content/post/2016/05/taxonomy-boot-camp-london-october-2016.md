[Synaptica](http://www.synaptica.com/), [poolparty](https://www.poolparty.biz/) and [ISKO UK](http://www.iskouk.org/) are sponsoring a two-day Taxonomy Boot Camp on **18th and 19th October,** 
to help further new applications and the development of skill sets in taxonomy construction. Organizations are increasingly 
recognizing the value of taxonomies to drive their data, content and information processes and this event will help explore 
different approaches to establishing taxonomy. The event programme will be available from June 2016.
