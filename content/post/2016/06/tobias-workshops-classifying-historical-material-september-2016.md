The workshops are based on the Institute of Historical Research's (IHR) digital [Tobias project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FN003446%2F1),
which is publishing the [Royal Historical Society](http://royalhistsoc.org/publications/bbih/)’s
detailed vocabulary of British and Irish history as linked data (LOD), making it freely available for the first time.

The workshops will discuss the concept of linked data, the RHS vocabulary itself,
the Bibliography of British and Irish History (which uses the vocabulary), and
the project’s experiments in using the vocabulary to automatically classify historical
material, including a case study of the [John Johnson Collection](http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/johnson).

This event is particularly aimed at people with a background in libraries, archives
and museums: academics and others might prefer to attend the [related event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tobias-classifying-historical-material-using-the-rhs-vocabulary-tickets-25841110457) on 14 September 2016.
