The [Getty Conservation Institute](http://www.getty.edu/conservation/) (USA)
has entered into collaborative agreements with [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/)
and the City of Lincoln Council (England) to implement the [Arches software platform](https://community.getty.edu/page.redir?target=http%3a%2f%2farchesproject.org&srcid=15853&srctid=1&erid=17302284&trid=e5a37d0e-6840-461c-a3d9-354441d8e23b),
which will categorize, map, and describe the rich cultural heritage of [Greater London](https://historicengland.org.uk/services-skills/our-planning-services/greater-london-archaeology-advisory-service/greater-london-historic-environment-record/)
and the City of Lincoln.

The partnership provides a new way for the three organizations to work together
to promote the understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment of these cities and their histories.
