Welcome to the Forum on Information Standards in Heritage (FISH). This site presents the work of the forum and contains links to recommended information resources that support best practice in recording cultural heritage.

We hope the site will give you an overview of the different documentation guidance and indexing tools available and used by our members. Please help us keep the website current and update us on any additional or future resources, initiatives and conferences.

The forum is guided by the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) for data management and stewardship. This seeks to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

Membership is free. Join by subscribing to the [FISH Mailing List](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=FISH) and participate in our forum discussions where all meeting papers and presentations are also made available.

Forum meetings are held twice a year, to discuss strategic and technical issues and developments. The meetings combine the efforts of both [FISH and HEIRNET](/fish-heirnet) (Historic Environment Information Resources Network), two organisations with similar interests and aims.

A smaller Terminology Working Group also meets regularly, to discuss vocabulary issues and candidate terms for the collection of thesauri and authority files produced by or on behalf of FISH.

FISH was established in 1998 as a non for profit organisation. We are a formally convened group with [terms of reference](/terms-of-reference/) and a national profile. FISH is not a legal entity and we have no employed staff, income or budget. There are currently over 400 members.
