FISH member organizations have compiled chronological guides to assist with the identification of archaeological and cultural periods. 
Time periods vary depending on geographical focus and archaeological science disciplines so dates should not be taken as definitive or 
absolute and are very much open to debate.

A key guide for dating Britain's historic sites and monuments is Historic England's Periods List (see below). Other resources 
include the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW).

The full chronological guide for recording sites and monuments can be downloaded [here](/2023/04/NewHE_Periods3.csv)
