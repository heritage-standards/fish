_Terminology working group, member organizations & specialist meetings_

A number of sub-groups have formed at different times to assist with the development of various FISH projects and products.  The _Terminology Working Group_ meet regularly, but otherwise the _FISH Mailing List_ is used for online discussions on general, technical or subject specific issues. E-conferences are sometimes organized to invite group discussion and consensus on changes or amendments to FISH standards or guidance.

To join the mailing list, please go to [FISH JISCMail](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=FISH). To join a working group, please contact [FISH](mailto:mailto:terminologies@HistoricEngland.org.uk).

### Terminology Working Group

The FISH Terminology Working Group (FISH TWG) help support thesauri development within the heritage sector. Meetings are held twice yearly (Spring/ Autumn), usually in London. Number of attending members is limited to 12 to 15 to keep the meetings focused but anyone can become a corresponding member.

Chair for these meetings is Phil Carlisle, Historic England.

### Specialist meetings

In addition to the general terminology meetings, members also meet to discuss amendments to specific subject areas, such as terminology for landforms, sediments and lithics. This will involve revision of the FISH Monument Type Thesaurus, where for example a new class will be developed called 'natural features', and the FISH Archaeological Objects Thesaurus. This may be followed by a review of the _FISH_ Evidence Thesaurus with regard to recording palaeoenvironmental evidence.
